Hi Andr=C3=A9s!

Thank you for your reply! Si prefer=C3=ADs, podemos hablar en espa=C3=B1ol,=
 avisame!

No, the website is not up yet, since it is on project. Because of that, I
need to understand the market so I can define which brands will be sold in
it. So far, I haven't done any deals with specific brands, though I'm in
negotiations with a few of them, just as with Brazilian clubs and the
National Confederation (CBRu).

For starters, I'm interested in England's national team jerseys (XV and
7s). Could you send me the prices for resellers?

We're talking about a 5-10 pieces estimation.

How would be the shipping for S=C3=A3o Paulo, Brazil? Is it from Santiago o=
r
elsewhere? How much time will it take to get here?

What information will you be needing for the transaction, how is it done
and what are the conditions Canterbury asks?

Thank you so much,

Daniel Indech
