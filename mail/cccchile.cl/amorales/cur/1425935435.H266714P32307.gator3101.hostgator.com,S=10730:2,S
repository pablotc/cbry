Dear Andr=C3=A9s,

Hope this message finds you well!
In order to supply apparel from China into Brazil you must have a
registered import company to do so.
This would be the fastest way to reach the local market and also the best
cost effective solution.
It is bureaucratic at the beginning, but once everything is in place, thing
should run smoothly.

I used to be a rugby player. I am now almost 40 and I play only for fun, in
a veteran team in my home town Sao Jose dos Campos.
Most of the teams in Brazil are located in Sao Paulo state.
Also, the teams in Brazil are supplied by local companies (Shield Rugby,
Sanrad, Scrum5, etc).
There is no team supplied by international brands. The only exception is
the Saracens Bandeirantes S=C3=A3o Paulo that is wearing Nike.
Since rugby is an amateur sport in Brazil, most of the clubs does not have
budget to import gear and apparel.

Let me know if the above helps.

Best regards,
Andr=C3=A9.
